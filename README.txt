Gameplay

'Battle for Endor...Again' is a Star Wars iteration on a dodger game. The player controls a Rebel X-Wing and must
dodge enemy TIE Fighters, Star Destroyers, and even Death Stars. Touch any of the enemies, and it is game over.
Be careful - the larger ships have invisible energy fields that can possibly destroy you before you reach them.
Interspersed between the enemy ships are energy nodes. The player can siphon energy from these nodes. The
longer you stay in contact with a node, the more energy you will siphon. Besides the game time counter,
there are two other counters on the screen. An energy counter keeps track of how much energy you
have siphoned from the nodes. When it reaches 20, a burst of energy is released and all the TIE Fighters
are killed. The energy counter is reset to 0 and starts building again. Each time you destroy the TIE Fighters,
secret tech, only recently implemented on your X-Wing, collects the energy and stores it as a power boost.
Using a power boost kills all of the Star Destroyers and Death Stars in your way. The game is won by holding off
the enemy ships that are attacking the planet Endor until the Rebel Fleet can arrive. Good Luck!
